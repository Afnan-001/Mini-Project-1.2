## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema

#### Booking Model (`/app/models/Booking.ts`)
```typescript
{
  customerId: ObjectId,     // Reference to customer
  ownerId: ObjectId,        // Reference to turf owner
  turfId: ObjectId,         // Reference to turf
  slot: {
    day: String,            // Day of the week
    startTime: String,      // HH:MM format
    endTime: String         // HH:MM format
  },
  status: String,           // pending/confirmed/rejected
  paymentScreenshot: {
    url: String,            // Cloudinary URL
    public_id: String       // Cloudinary public ID
  },
  totalAmount: Number,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### Booking Management
- `POST /api/bookings/create` - Create new booking with payment screenshot
- `GET /api/bookings/owner/[ownerId]` - Fetch owner's booking requests
- `GET /api/bookings/customer/[customerId]` - Fetch customer's bookings
- `PUT /api/bookings/update-status` - Approve or reject booking

#### Turf Management
- `GET /api/turfs/[id]` - Get turf details with real-time slot availability

### Components

#### Customer Components
- `TurfDetailsPage` - Main booking page with slot selection
- `PaymentModal` - UPI payment and screenshot upload
- `CustomerBookingHistory` - Track booking status

#### Owner Components
- `BookingManager` - Manage booking requests in dashboard

## üöÄ Usage Flow

### 1. Customer Books a Turf

```typescript
// Customer navigates from /browse to /book/[turfId]
// Selects available slot and proceeds to payment
// Uploads payment screenshot
// Booking created with status: 'pending'
```

### 2. Owner Reviews Booking

```typescript
// Owner sees notification in dashboard
// Reviews customer details and payment screenshot
// Clicks Approve/Reject
// Status updates to 'confirmed'/'rejected'
// Slot becomes unavailable if approved
```

### 3. Customer Tracks Status

```typescript
// Customer can view booking status in their dashboard
// Real-time updates when owner approves/rejects
// Contact information available for communication
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### Slot Availability Logic
- When displaying slots, system checks for confirmed bookings
- Booked slots are marked as unavailable and disabled
- Real-time updates prevent double bookings

### Payment Verification
- Customers upload payment screenshots to Cloudinary
- Owners can view full-size images for verification
- Payment amount and booking details are cross-referenced

### Status Management
- **Pending**: Initial status after booking creation
- **Confirmed**: Owner approves - slot becomes unavailable
- **Rejected**: Owner rejects - slot remains available

### Security Features
- Owner verification for booking management
- File type and size validation for uploads
- Transaction-based database operations
- Input validation and sanitization

## üì± UI/UX Features

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly buttons and inputs
- Optimized image galleries

### User Feedback
- Loading states for all operations
- Success/error messages
- Status badges and icons
- Real-time updates

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader compatibility

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB database
- Cloudinary account for image storage

### Environment Variables
```bash
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
